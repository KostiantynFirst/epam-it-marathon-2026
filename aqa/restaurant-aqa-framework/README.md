# Homework solution — Test Automation #8

**Direction:** 1 — group pre-order. The tests run against **my own deployed application**: my backend homework
(API Gateway + Lambda on AWS) and my frontend homework (S3 + CloudFront).

**Approach:** BDD + Screenplay, built on this framework. Gherkin describes the business rules
(`Features/GroupPreOrder*.feature`), thin step definitions hand the work to Screenplay tasks and questions
(`Screenplay/`), which use the API clients (`Api/GroupPreOrdersApi.cs`) and the page object (`Ui/GroupOrderPage.cs`).

## What is covered

Following the test pyramid of the assignment:

| Level | UI — `Features/GroupPreOrderStorefront.feature` (`@ui`) | API — `Features/GroupPreOrderService.feature` (`@api`) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — view | host reviews carts (confirmed / still choosing, subtotals, grand total); sees a guest's confirmation without leaving the screen; empty group | all participants with dishes, totals, confirmed flag (incl. one without dishes); total = sum of participants and follows a cart change; empty group; another customer / guest / waiter / visitor refused; group that does not exist |
| 2 — submit | same dishes merged, unconfirmed carts left out, "Sent to Restaurant"; **waiter sees the order** with exactly that content | consolidated order; no confirmed cart; no order for the booking; group / booking that does not exist; submitting twice; another customer / guest / waiter / visitor refused |
| 3 — remove | host removes a guest, totals follow; **end-to-end**: guests' carts → host reviews → removes one → submits → waiter sees the order without the removed guest | one of several (total recalculated); a removed participant's confirmed cart is not sent; the last participant; a participant of another group; someone who never joined; another customer / guest / waiter / visitor refused |

Guests and all test data are prepared through the API (as the pyramid suggests): a fresh table and three dishes
with round prices in the test location, a freshly registered host, a booking on a random future day, the host's
own pre-order, the invite. Everything is removed after the scenario (booking cancelled, dishes and table deleted;
the `AQA-Sample-` sweep catches leftovers), so scenarios are independent and can run in parallel.

## Behaviour chosen where the assignment does not define it

| Case | Chosen behaviour (tested) |
|---|---|
| Not the host, but signed in (another customer, the waiter) | `403` — "Only the reservation owner …" |
| Not signed in as a customer (no token, or a guest's session token) | `401` from the API Gateway authorizer |
| Group that does not exist | `404` |
| Booking that does not exist (submit) | `404` |
| No confirmed cart / no order for the booking | `400` with the reason in the message |
| Submitting an already submitted group | `400` "Group reservation was submitted." |
| Removing a participant of another group | `400` "Guest session does not belong to this group reservation." |
| Removing someone who never joined | `404` |
| Removing the last participant | `200`, `participants: []`, `total: 0` |
| Group nobody joined | `participants: []`, `total: 0` |

## Known limitations of the application (found while automating)

- **"Confirmed carts without any dish"** cannot be reached from outside: a guest cannot confirm an empty cart, and a confirmed cart can no longer be changed — so this submit refusal is not automated.
- The backend never creates the **host's own guest session**, so the screen shows guests only (no "My Pre-Order" card); the host's own dishes reach the restaurant through the host's regular pre-order, which the scenarios check on the waiter's side.
- The host's screen loads the group through the guests' invite endpoint, which refuses a **full** group or one that is **no longer open**. The scenarios therefore book for 6 guests and use at most 3, and never reload the screen after submitting.
- The waiter's view is checked through the order the waiter receives from the service (the waiter's role and token), not through the waiter dashboard.
- Adding a dish to a location's menu reads the location, appends the dish and saves the whole record, so two dishes added **at the same moment** overwrite each other and one silently drops off the menu. Every scenario adds its own dishes to the shared test location, so both group pre-order features are tagged `@sequential` (Reqnroll marks them not-in-parallel) and run one after another.

## Configure and run

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in **your own** deployment:
   - `UI_URL` — the frontend (e.g. `https://<id>.cloudfront.net`), `API_URL` — the API including the stage (`…/develop`);
   - `WAITER_USERNAME` / `WAITER_PASSWORD` — a standing waiter: register a customer, then make them a waiter of a location with `POST /waiters` `{"email": "…", "locationId": "…"}`;
   - `TESTLOCATION_ID` — that location (every booking is handed to one of the location's waiters).
2. Run:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=group-pre-order]"   # the whole homework
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=level-2]"           # one level
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=api]"               # one layer (api / ui)
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=smoke]"             # smoke
```

Tags: `@group-pre-order`, `@level-1` / `@level-2` / `@level-3`, `@ui` / `@api`, `@smoke`, `@negative`, `@e2e`.

**Reports:** everything lands in `TestResults/` — TUnit HTML report and TRX, the Reqnroll HTML report in
`TestResults/reqnroll/`, and a Playwright trace for every failed UI scenario in `TestResults/traces/`
(`npx playwright show-trace <file>.zip`).

**CI:** `.github/workflows/aqa-tests.yml` runs the group pre-order scenarios on every push to `main` that touches the
tests, nightly, and on demand (Actions → AQA Tests → Run workflow → choose a scope: a level, `ui`, `api`, `smoke`, or
`all`). A failing test does not stop the pipeline: the reports, the TRX and the traces are uploaded as artifacts and a
summary is written to the run. `aqa-quality.yml` checks format, build (analyzers as errors), Gherkin lint and test
discovery on every push. Configuration comes from repository variables (`AQA_UI_URL`, `AQA_API_URL`,
`AQA_TESTLOCATION_ID`) and secrets (`AQA_WAITER_USERNAME`, `AQA_WAITER_PASSWORD`).

# Restaurant AQA framework

End-to-end tests for the Green & Tasty restaurant application: Reqnroll (Gherkin) + TUnit + Playwright for .NET, with the Screenplay pattern.

Guidance for extending the suite (writing Gherkin, steps, Screenplay, test data, working with an AI assistant) is in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Run the tests

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in your own values (see "Configuration")
dotnet build
dotnet run --no-build -- --report-trx                          # everything
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=smoke]"   # by tag
```

Everything a run produces lands in `TestResults/`: the TUnit report and TRX, the Reqnroll report in `reqnroll/`, and Playwright traces in `traces/` (open one with `npx playwright show-trace <file>.zip`).

Some scenarios are expected to fail (`@known-defect`, bugs in the application) or are skipped (`@wip`, no admin account configured). That is intentional.

## Quality gates

| Where | What runs |
|---|---|
| Git hooks (local) | `pre-commit`: `dotnet format` check and Gherkin lint on staged files · `commit-msg`: Conventional Commits · `pre-push`: build with analyzers |
| `aqa-quality.yml` | on every push and pull request: no generated files tracked, format, build (warnings are errors), Gherkin lint, test discovery |
| `aqa-tests.yml` | the scenarios themselves, nightly and on demand (Actions → AQA Tests → Run workflow) |

Enable the hooks once per clone, from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet tool restore --tool-manifest aqa/restaurant-aqa-framework/.config/dotnet-tools.json
git config core.hooksPath aqa/restaurant-aqa-framework/.husky
```

The hooks only act on commits and pushes that touch `aqa/restaurant-aqa-framework`. Gherkin lint needs Node.js.

## Configuration

There is no shared environment and no committed `.env`: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in with the data of **your own** deployment (see "Testing your own deployment"). `.env` is git-ignored; never commit it.

Settings come from `.env` or real environment variables (variables win):

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UI_URL` | where the frontend is served |
| `API_URL` | base URL of the backend API, including the stage (for example `…/develop`) |
| `WAITER_USERNAME`, `WAITER_PASSWORD` | a waiter account that already exists in the environment under test |
| `TESTTABLE_ID`, `TESTTABLE_WAITER_*` | a table and the waiter assigned to it (only for scenarios that need them) |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | an admin account; without it the admin scenarios are skipped |

The full list, with defaults, is in `.env.example`.

## Testing your own deployment

### If you deployed the backend / frontend / DevOps homework

1. `cp .env.example .env` and set `UI_URL` and `API_URL` to your deployment (API URL includes the stage, for example `…/develop`).
2. Waiters cannot be created by signing up, so create a waiter (and, for the admin scenarios, an admin) in *your* environment and put its credentials in `WAITER_*` / `ADMIN_*`. Optionally add a table and its assigned waiter (`TESTTABLE_*`).
3. Run `dotnet build` and a small slice first (`--treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=smoke]"`).

### If you have not deployed your own homework

If you deployed the original application, test that: set `UI_URL` / `API_URL` as above. Otherwise point the framework at a comparable public site (Booking, Airbnb, OpenTable, …) and write all the layers for it yourself: Gherkin features, step definitions, Screenplay tasks and questions, page objects with locators, and API clients where the site has a usable API. Use only flows you are allowed to automate (no purchases, no real bookings, respect the site's terms), and set `UI_URL` to that site.

1. **Generate a skeleton with Playwright codegen** (see "Presetup instructions"): record one flow, for example search → open a result → check details. Save the generated code to a scratch file, it is only raw material.
2. **Split it across the layers**: locators and small actions go to `Ui/` page objects, the flow becomes a task in `Screenplay/Tasks/`, the read-backs become questions in `Screenplay/Questions/`, the business wording goes to `Features/` and thin glue to `StepDefinitions/`.
3. **Replace weak locators.** Codegen often emits positional or text-fragile selectors. Prefer role + accessible name, label, test id, then CSS (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)); check them in the Playwright inspector.
4. Tag scenarios `@ui` / `@api`, keep them independent, and run `npx gherkin-lint -c .gherkin-lintrc "Features/*.feature"`.

### CI on your own public repository

Publish your work in your own public Git repository (the link is the deliverable). Workflows are disabled in a fresh fork until you enable them. Add the same values under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- **Variables:** `AQA_UI_URL`, `AQA_API_URL`, `AQA_TESTTABLE_ID`
- **Secrets:** `AQA_WAITER_USERNAME`, `AQA_WAITER_PASSWORD`, `AQA_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `AQA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `AQA_TESTTABLE_WAITER_USERNAME`, `AQA_TESTTABLE_WAITER_PASSWORD`

`aqa-quality.yml` runs on every push and pull request; `aqa-tests.yml` (nightly and on demand) tests whatever those variables point at. Never put credentials in the repository, in `.env.example` or in test code.

## Presetup instructions

This framework contains PlaywriteInstaller script so you don't need to setup it manually.
For full BDD highlighting in your IDE you may need to install Reqnroll extension https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/ide-integrations/index.html
To start the Playwright code generator open Powershell in the framework directory and enter the line:
```bash
bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 codegen "<your UI_URL or the public site you test>"
```
Build first so `playwright.ps1` exists. The URL is optional.
